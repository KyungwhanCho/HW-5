# Q1. My teammate : Alanna Knights

# Q2. Using the given data, we try to figure out what are the differences of wages and age distribution on workfield made by the major of the people.
# a) In order to clarify the difference were made by the major that have chosen, we restricted data to the people only who went to 4-year college and no more advanced education.
# b) We expanded the age of the group form 25~70 because we considered that the retirement age nowadays became older.
# c) We selected the group 1, Business major people, and the group 2, Fine Arts major people because we assumed that would show the most vivid difference.
# d) We plotted each group in respect to age and wages.

# Intersting things we found:
# We found that the median wage of group 1 was about $10K higher than group 2.
# We found that the age distribution of each group was very different. The plot dots of group 2 were densely concentrated in 20~30 age area compared to group 1.

# Conclusion
# We found that using the information, by categorizing people by certain educational factor can show us not only the insights of wage difference but also many different factors that matters for people when they choose the job and major.
